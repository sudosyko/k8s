# SA II Project: on Kubernetes Cluster 

## About this Project 

This is the project documentation for the System Administration II course at TSBE. 
This Project covers installing and scaling  on Kubernetes. 

The goal is to install and build a Kubernetes cluster with the following requirements in place:
* scalability through the orchestration with Kubernetes
* containers with persistant storage i.E. a Database
* working container networking with portforwarding for external access
* secure configuration to minimize security risk

The repository also includes the ressources used for this project (check the archive for failed attempts ðŸ˜‰)

## Platform & Limitations

The following virtual plattform is hosted by the school to execute the project:

![smart-learn-plan](Docs/Pictures/smart_learn_refference.png)

### vmKL1
The **vmKL1** is the management machine used to setup, administer and access the kubernetes cluster.

The VM Specs are:
* OS: Kali GNU/Linux Rolling (Graphical)
* Kernel: Linux 6.5.0-kali3-amd64
* CPU: 2 vCPUs
* RAM: 16 GB
* Storage: /dev/sda 35 GB 
* Network: Access to vmLM1 & Internet
* IP: 192.168.110.70

Installed Software:

* vscode
* vim
* tmux
* ansible

### vmLM1
The **vmLM1** is the Kubernetes host itself. It will act as Control Plane (Master Node) & Data Plane (Worker Node), as this is the only server provided for the project.

The VM Specs are:
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
* Kernel: Linux 
* CPU: 4 vCPUs
* RAM: 12 GB
* Storage: /dev/sda 16 GB
* Network: Access to vmKL1 & Internet
* IP: 192.168.110.60

Installed Software:

* minikube


## Manual Setup Guide

### Pre-Requisites vmlKL1:

```bash
# Update the System
sudo apt update -y && apt upgrade -y

# Install the following packages:
sudo apt install -y tmux vim snapd

# Enable & start the snap store
sudo systemctl enable snapd
sudo systemctl start snapd

# Install vscode with snap store
sudo snap install --classic code 
```

Applications installed with the snap store arenÂ´t stored in /usr/bin therefore they are only available over the full path (/snap/bin/code)
>Fix this with the following command:
```bash
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/code /usr/bin/code
```

### Pre-Requisites vmLM1:

```bash
# Enable & open necessary ports on server firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 10443/tcp
sudo ufw enable

# Enable ssh access by uncommenting the following line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Port 22

# restart sshd
sudo systemctl restart sshd

# Update the System
sudo apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
```

> Now vmLM1 is accessible over ssh!

### Install & initialy setup Kubernetes on vmLM1

```bash
## AS root:
# Install minikube

```
